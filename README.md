brain-python-interface (a.k.a. bmi3d)
====================================
This package contains Python code to run brain-machine interface (BMIs) tasks as well as other neurophysiology experiments. This package differs from other similar packages (e.g., BCI2000--http://www.schalklab.org/research/bci2000) in that it is primarily intended for intracortical BMI experiments. 

This package was originally written for Python 2. The code has been updated to run with Python 3, but is currently unstable.
